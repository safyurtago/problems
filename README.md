This repository shares my experience in solving leetcode problems. The first edition was written in Python3, and now I am working on resolving them with Java8. There are articles describing the solution. For further information, please see the Articles part.

## Problems

You can find all the problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com).

## Issue

You are welcome if you have any question or suggestion.

## Tag

I have classified the problems into different tags like the leetcode OJ does. You can check them [here](./TAG.md).

## Articles

There are articles about each problem, describing how I solve that problem. You can visit them on [GitBook](https://shenjie1993.gitbooks.io/leetcode-python/content/) or [CSDN](http://blog.csdn.net/column/details/leetcode-python.html).

It is a pity that they are only in Chinese.
